# Custom Docs Theme

This directory contains a custom [MkDocs][mkdocs] theme. I prototyped it with
the documentation for [Tako][tako], but I intend to deploy it more widely, also
for [Pris][pris] and [Noblit][noblit]. It is not customizable: it supports
everything I need, and nothing more.

## Features

 * Responsive design
 * Zero javascript

## License

The theme is licensed under the [Apache 2.0][apache2] license. In the generated
documentation, it is fine to just link to this readme.
